About this Workshop
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In recent years, information channels have become increasingly distributed, 
opinionated, and vary in their information quality and trustworthiness of the 
stated facts and arguments. Comprehensive understanding, sense-making and informed 
discussions within a society require advanced technologies in natural language 
processing, text mining, information retrieval, and provenance analytics.
 
The development of advanced retrieval solutions requires the understanding and the 
combination of methods from different research areas, including machine learning, 
data mining, natural language processing, artificial intelligence, user interaction 
and modeling, Web engineering, and Big Data processing. This workshop provides a 
platform for presenting and discussing new solutions, novel ideas, or specific tools
in this regard. The following list organizes classic and recent topics for which 
contributions are welcome, but not limited to:


- Theory. Retrieval models, similarity measures, formal analysis

- Evaluation. Corpus construction, experiment design, performance measures

- Information Quality and Provenance. Text quality assessment, text reuse, trust 
  and author reputation, provenance analytics

- Natural Language Processing. Opinion mining, text summarization and simplification, 
  question answer-ing, discourse and argument mining

- Personalization. Personalized retrieval, context detection, user profiling, 
  user modeling
  
- Search User Interfaces. General purpose search, special purpose search, 
  adaptive interfaces, retrieval in cognitive settings

- Web Search. Ranking and recommendation, query classification and segmentation, 
  vertical search, dynamic taxonomy generation

- Social Media Analytics. People analytics, social network analysis, trend analysis

- Semantic Web. Meta data analysis and tagging, knowledge extraction, 
  inference and linking

- Deep Learning. Representation learning for text


The workshop is held for the fourteenth time. In the past, it was characterized by a 
stimulating atmosphere, and it attracted high quality contributions from all over the world.
Accepted papers will appear in the proceedings of DEXA’17 Workshops published by 
the Conference Publish-ing Services (CPS) of IEEE Computer Society.
