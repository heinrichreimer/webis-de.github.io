About this Workshop
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Intelligent algorithms for text analytics are the key technology to cope
with the information need challenges in our media-centered society. Methods
for information retrieval and natural language processing receive special
attention, which results from the important role of written text, from the
high availability of the World Wide Web, and from the enormous impact of Web
communities and social media on our life.

The development of advanced text analytics solutions requires the
understanding and the combination of methods from different research areas,
including machine learning, data mining, natural language processing,
artificial intelligence, user interaction and modeling, Web engineering, and
Big Data processing. This workshop provides a platform for presenting and
discussing new solutions, novel ideas, or specific tools in this regard. The
following list organizes classic and recent topics for which contributions
are welcome, but not limited to:

- Theory. Retrieval models, similarity measures, formal analysis

- Evaluation. Corpus construction, experiment design, performance measures

- Information Quality. Text quality assessment, text reuse, trust and
  author reputation

- Natural Language Processing. Opinion mining, text summarization and
  simplification, question answering, discourse and argument mining

- Personalization. Personalized retrieval, context detection, user profiling

- Search User Interfaces. General purpose search, special purpose search,
  adaptive interfaces

- Web Search. Ranking and recommendation, query classification and segmentation,
  vertical search

- Social Media Analytics. People analytics, social network analysis, trend analysis

- Semantic Web. Meta data analysis and tagging, knowledge extraction and inference

- Text Mining and Classification. Topic identification, dynamic taxonomy generation

- Big Data Text Analytics. Online algorithms for NLP applications, parallel
  and distributed retrieval

- Deep Learning. Representation learning for text


The workshop is held for the thirteenth time. In the past, it was
characterized by a stimulating atmosphere, and it attracted high quality
contributions from all over the world.

Accepted papers will appear in the proceedings of DEXA'16 Workshops published
by the Conference Publishing Services (CPS) of IEEE Computer Society.
