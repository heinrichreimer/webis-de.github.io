About this Workshop
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Intelligent algorithms for data mining and information retrieval are the key 
technology to cope with the information need challenges in our 
media-centered society. Methods for text-based information retrieval receive
special attention, which results from the important role of written text,
from the high availability of the World Wide Web, and from the enormous
impact of Web communities and social media on our life.

The development of advanced information retrieval solutions requires the
understanding and the combination of methods from different research areas, 
including machine learning, data mining, computer linguistics, artificial
intelligence, user interaction and modeling, Web engineering, or distributed
systems. This workshop provides a platform for presenting and discussing
new solutions, novel ideas, or specific tools focusing on text-based
information retrieval. The following list organizes classic and recent 
topics for which contributions are welcome, but are not limited to: 


- Theory. Retrieval models, language models, similarity measures, formal 
  analysis

- Web Search. Ranking and recommendation, indexing, semantic search, social 
  search, query classification and segmentation, vertical search, authority

- Personalization and User Mining. Just-in-time retrieval, personalized
  retrieval, context detection, user profiling

- Multilinguality. Cross-language retrieval, parallel text mining

- Evaluation. Corpus construction, experiment design, performance measures

- Text Mining and Classification. Text reuse, topic identification,
  sentiment analysis, opinion mining, dynamic taxonomy generation

- NLP. Information extraction, text summarization and simplification,
  named entity recognition, question answering, representation learning

- Social Media Analysis. Social network analysis, trend analysis,
  information diffusion, short text retrieval

- Information Quality. Text quality assessment, quality-based ranking, 
  readability assessment, trust and author reputation

- Big Data Text Analytics. Parallel and distributed retrieval, online 
  algorithms, scalability

- Semantic Web. Meta data analysis and tagging, knowledge extraction,
  inference, maintenance

- Deep Learning. Natural language understanding, information retrieval


The workshop is held for the twelfth time. In the past, it was 
characterized by a stimulating atmosphere, and it attracted high quality
contributions from all over the world.

Accepted papers will appear in the proceedings of DEXA’15 Workshops published by the Conference Publishing Services (CPS) of IEEE Computer
Society.
