About this Workshop
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Intelligent algorithms for data mining and information retrieval are the key
technology to cope with the information need challenges in our
media-centered society. Methods for text-based information retrieval receive
special attention, which results from the important role of written text,
from the high availability of the World Wide Web, and from the enormous
impact of Web communities and social media on our life.

The development of advanced information retrieval solutions requires the
understanding and the combination of methods from different research areas,
including machine learning, data mining, computer linguistics, artificial
intelligence, user interaction and modeling, Web engineering, or distributed
systems. This workshop provides a common platform for presenting and
discussing new solutions, novel ideas, or specific tools focusing on
text-based information retrieval. The following list organizes classic and
ongoing topics for which contributions are welcome, but are not limited to:

 - Theory. Retrieval models, language models, similarity measures, formal
   analysis

 - Web Search. Ranking, indexing, semantic search, query classification and
   segmentation, relevance feedback, vertical search

 - Personalization and User Mining. Just-in-time retrieval, personalized
   retrieval, context detection, profile mining

 - Multilinguality. Cross-language retrieval, machine translation, language
   identification

 - Evaluation. Corpus construction, experiment design, performance measures

 - Text Mining and Classification. Web mining, text reuse, topic
   identification, sentiment analysis

 - NLP. Information extraction, text summarization and simplification, named
   entity recognition, question answering

 - Social Media Analysis. Community mining, social network analysis, trend
   analysis, information diffusion

 - Information Quality. Text quality assessment, quality-based ranking,
   readability assessment, trust and author reputation

 - Big Data Text Analytics. Parallel and distributed retrieval, online
   algorithms, scalability

 - Semantic Web. Meta data analysis and tagging, knowledge extraction,
   inference, maintenance

The workshop is held for the eleventh time. In the past, it was
characterized by a stimulating atmosphere, and it attracted high quality
contributions from all over the world.

Accepted papers will appear in the proceedings of DEXA'14 Workshops
published by the Conference Publishing Services (CPS) of IEEE Computer
Society.
