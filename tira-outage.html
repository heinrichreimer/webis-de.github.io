        <h1>TIRA Platform Outage</h1>

        <p>
            Dear TIRA Platform users,

            we are currently experiencing a partial power outage of our cluster where TIRA services are running. We estimate all TIRA services being fully operational on Monday Apr 26th. We apologize for the inconvenience.
        </p>

        <p>
            Those virtual machines created earlier are not affected and can still be used. Should you experience issues with connections via SSH/RDP, please let us know.<br/>
        </p>

        <p>
            TIRA Platform Team<br/>
